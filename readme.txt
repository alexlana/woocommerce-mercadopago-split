Offer to your clients the best experience in e-Commerce by using Mercado Pago as your payment method.

== Description ==

The official Mercado Pago plugin allows you to process payments for your online store, allowing users to finalize their purchase with their preferred payment method.

To install it, **you don't need to have technical knowledge:** you can follow the [step by step of how to integrate it](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/es/guides/plugins/woocommerce/introduction/). from our developer website and start selling today.

### What to do with the Mercado Pago Plugin?
* Activate **Checkout Pro** to offer logged-in payments with money in Mercado Pago account, saved cards and off means.
* Offer payments without the need of having a Mercado Pago account, through the **Custom Checkout** for cards and off means (cash or bank transfer).
* Automatically convert the currency of your products: from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars and vice versa.
* Sell in **installments** and offer the current promotions in Checkout Pro or apply your own discount coupon in Custom Checkout.
* Test your store before going into production with our Sandbox environment.
* **Receive the money** from your sales on the same day.
* **IMPORTANT:** At the moment the Mercado Envíos service is deactivated.

### Adapted to your business

Prepared for any type of store and category: electronics, clothing, kitchen, bazaar, whatever you want!
Just focus on selling and **we'll take care of the security:** keep your store's payments protected with our fraud prevention and analysis tool.

3. This is what the Customized Checkout looks like in your store. You can activate payments with cards and also cash.
4. Once you install the Mercado Pago Plugin, you will find the 3 checkouts available in the Payment settings in WooCommerce. You can activate them simultaneously or choose one of them. Remember that they must be configured before enabling them.
5. To configure it, follow the step by step indicated in each Checkout. Remember that you can review the official documentation of our plugin on the Mercado Pago developer website.
6. ACCEPT ALL PAYMENT METHODS

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I had a question during setup, where can I check the documentation? =

In our developer website you will find the step by step of [how to integrate the Mercado Pago Plugin](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/es/guides/plugins/woocommerce/introduction/) in your online store.

= What are the requirements for the plugin to work properly? =

You must have an SSL certificate, connecting your website with the HTTPS protocol.

If you need to check the protocol configuration, [test it here](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

Finally, remember that the plugin receives IPN (Instant Payment Notification) notifications automatically, you don't need to configure it!

= I already finished the configuration but the Sandbox environment is not working. =

Remember that to test the Checkout Pro you must log out of your Mercado Pago account, as it is not possible to use it to sell and buy at the same time.

Please note that with the Test Environment enabled, the Checkout Pro does not send notifications as does the Custom Checkout.

= How do I configure the sending of emails to my customers? =

The configuration of sending emails must be done from the WooCommerce administrator. The Mercado Pago Plugin only contemplates sending transactions made in the Checkout Pro.

= I reviewed the documentation and these FAQs but still have problems in my store, what can I do? =

If you have already reviewed the documentation and have not found a solution, you can contact our support team through their [contact form](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/es/support/). Please note that we guarantee a response within {7 days} of your query.
